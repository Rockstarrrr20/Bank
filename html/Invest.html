        <b>Investment</b> is traditionally defined as the "commitment of resources to achieve later benefits". If an
        investment involves money, then it can be defined as a "commitment of money to receive more money later". From a
        broader viewpoint, an investment can be defined as "to tailor the pattern of expenditure and receipt of
        resources to optimise the desirable patterns of these flows". When expenditure and receipts are defined in terms
        of money, then the net monetary receipt in a time period is termed as <b>cash flow</b>, while money received in
        a series of several time periods is termed as cash flow stream. Investment science is the application of
        scientific tools (usually mathematical) for investments.<br>

        In<b>finance</b>, the purpose of investing is to generate a return from the invested asset. The return may
        consist of a gain (profit) or a loss realized from the sale of a property or an investment, unrealized capital
        appreciation (or depreciation), or investment income such as dividends, interest, or rental income, or a
        combination of capital gain and income. The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in
        the foreign currency exchange rates.<br>

        Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. When a low-risk investment is made, the
        return is also generally low. Similarly, high risk comes with a chance of high losses.<br>

        Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to diversify their portfolio. Diversification has the
        statistical effect of reducing overall risk.<br>

        <h1>Investment and risk</h1><br>
        <hr>
        An investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested. Investment differs from arbitrage,
        in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.<br>

        Savings bear the (normally remote) risk that the financial provider may default.<br>

        Foreign currency savings also bear foreign exchange risk: if the currency of a savings account differs from the
        account holder's home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will
        move unfavourably so that the value of the savings account decreases, measured in the account holder's home
        currency.<br>

        Even investing in tangible assets like property has its risk. And similar to most risks, property buyers can
        seek to mitigate any potential risk by taking out mortgage and by borrowing at a lower loan to security
        ratio.<br>

        In contrast with savings, investments tend to carry more risk, in the form of both a wider variety of risk
        factors and a greater level of uncertainty.<br>

        Industry to industry volatility is more or less of a risk depending. In biotechnology, for example, investors
        look for big profits on companies that have small market capitalizations but can be worth hundreds of millions
        quite quickly. The risk is high because approximately 90% of biotechnology products researched do not make it to
        market due to regulations and the complex demands within pharmacology as the average prescription drug takes 10
        years and US$2.5 billion worth of capital.<br>

        This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2018)
        The Code of Hammurabi (developed during his reign between 1792-1750 BC) provided a legal framework for
        investment, establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard
        to pledged land. Punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving
        injury or death.<br>

        In the medieval Islamic world, the qirad was a major financial instrument. This was an arrangement between one
        or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in
        hopes of making a profit. Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the
        agent was not liable for any losses. Many will notice that the qirad is similar to the institution of the
        commenda later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda or the two
        institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.<br>

        In the early 1900s, purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media, academia, and
        commerce as speculators. Since the Wall Street crash of 1929, and particularly by the 1950s, the term investment
        had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while speculation was applied by
        financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time.[6] Since
        the last half of the 20th century, the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher
        risk ventures.<br>

        Investors famous for their success include Warren Buffett, who ranked second in the Forbes 400 list of the March
        2013 edition of Forbes magazine.[18] Buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good
        investment strategy is long-term and due diligence is the key to investing in the right assets.<br>

        Edward O. Thorp was a highly successful hedge fund manager in the 1970s and 1980s who spoke of a similar
        approach.<br>

        The investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the Kelly criterion for money
        management.[20] Numerous interactive calculators which use the Kelly criterion can be found online.<br>
